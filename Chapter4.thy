Soon to be filled in with some Hartshorne text. 

Key idea for this on 3/10: 

If you have a projective plane, defined by meets: points -> lines,
then you can define a NEW set of points:

type_equivalence ppoints = lines

and a new set of lines:

type_equivalence llines = points

in which you swap the role of "point" and "line". We already saw something like this in our 
work on the real projective plane, where I suggested that we could use the type "point" (3-coordinate
homogeneous vector) to represent a line (the "line" defined by "points in the plane orthogonal to the
given "normal" vector). 

With these two "new" types we can define a new "meets" function:

  fun dmeets :: "ppoint \<Rightarrow> lline \<Rightarrow> bool" where
    "dmeets P k = meets k P"

i.e., the "newpoint P" (which is really a line p) meets the "newline l" (which is really a point L)
exactly if L lies on p in our original projective plane. This new function, dmeets, (together with its
domain and codomain) constitutes a projective plane, called the "dual" of the original plane. 

To prove this, we have to (as usual) show the three axioms are true.
